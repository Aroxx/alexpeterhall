    <div id="about">
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-10">
          <p>I have been building websites in some form another since I was a kid and Angelfire/Geocities websites, Myspace, and super slow dial-up internet were all the rage. I took this interest in technology and studied Computer Information Systems in college where I received a broad education but I was always the most interested in web development and design. While my professional career has taken me to the quality assurance and operations side of the house I have always been the most engaged and enthusiastic when building something tangible from scratch, whether in the digital or physical world. I love taking things apart, learning the intricacies of the components, and putting it all together to build something that is far greater than just the sum of its parts.</p>
          <p><b>All of that to say, I am currently looking to bring my technical experience and web development knowledge into a front-end developer role that I am truly passionate about and focus my time on building awesome modern web apps that deliver real value to the business.</b> I know that "following your passion" is not only wildly overused these days but also really quite <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Why+following+your+passion+is+bad+advice" target="new">bad career advice</a>. But I really do enjoy building websites, even when the going gets tough, and wish to change gears in my professional career. Also, while it can sometimes feel overwhelming to have to keep learning the latest popular web framework that came out 4 days ago and will surely take the world by storm, I really do enjoy <i>learning</i> new things and it helps keep life from getting boring. Please reach out to me via <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/alexpeterhall" target="new">Linkedin</a> if you think I may be a fit for any such opportunities you have available.</p>
          <p>In addition to technical know-how, I also pride myself on continually learning leadership and communication skills so I can be as effective as possible in work and in life. I have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to work for a Fortune 50 company for the past 11 years that has given me not only a breadth and depth of experience in the IT domain but has also taught me the extreme importance of working well and collaborating with other people. Effective human communication and leadership are very hard and as such are career paths in their own right. When clear communication, perspective, and empathy are lacking, things can quickly break down and projects fail. All of the technology and collaboration tools in the world cannot replace the human element of the work we do. Nobody is perfect, but I believe my conscious acknowledgement of the challenges in this area, deliberate focus on clear and effective communication, consideration of other's perspectives, and my interest in developing leadership skills set me apart from many professionals who do not focus on this critical aspect of growth.</p>
          <p>If you've made it this far, wow! Thanks for sticking around and reading what I have to say. I'm a huge fan of quotes and aphorisms that pack a punch, so I'll leave you with this...</p>
